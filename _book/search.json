The shape of the distribution depends on its degrees of freedom (k). For \\(k=1\\), it’s highly skewed, but as k increases, it becomes more symmetric and approaches a normal distribution.\nWe learned that, when properly normalized \\(C_\\tau\\) follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no change. Therefore, our test statistics for a fixed \\(\\tau\\), \\(C_\\tau^2/\\sigma^2\\), follows a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom, being the square of a standard random variable. If we take the example of last week, and remove the changepoint, we can observe that the cusum statistics stays constant, and relatively small:\nHowever, as the change is unknown, our actual test statistic for detecting a change is \\(\\max_\\tau C_\\tau^2/σ^2\\).\nFor this reason, calculating the distribution of this maximum ends up being a bit more challenging…",

In time series analysis, we typically denote a time series by using an index \\(t\\) to represent time or order. The time series vector is written as:\n\\[\n  y_{1:n} = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)\n\\]\nHere, \\(n\\) is the total length of the sequence, and \\(y_t\\) represents the observed value at time \\(t\\), for \\(t = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\). In our previous example, for instance, \\(n = 100\\).\nOften, we are also interested in subsets of a time series (inclusive), especially when investigating specific “windows” or “chunks” of the data. We will denote as a subset of the time series, from time \\(l\\) to time \\(u\\), the following:\n\\[\n  y_{l:u} = (y_l, y_{l+1}, \\dots, y_u)\n\\]\nUnderstanding and working with subsets of time series data is important for many applications, such as when detecting changes in the behavior or properties of the time series over specific intervals.\n\n\n1.1.2 Stationary, non-stationary, and piecewise stationary time series\nTime series can be classified into different categories based on their statistical properties over time. The three main types are stationary, non-stationary, and piecewise stationary time series. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Time Series: A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties—such as the mean, variance, and autocovariance—are constant over time. This implies that the behavior of the series doesn’t change as time progresses.\n\nMathematically, for a stationary time series \\(y_t\\), the expected value and variance are constant over time: \\[\n    \\mathbb{E}(y_t) = \\mu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Var}(y_t) = \\sigma^2 \\quad \\forall \\in \\{1, ..., n\\}\n\\] In this example, the stationary time series was generated by sampling random normal variables \\(y_t = \\epsilon_t, \\ \\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\). We can see, very simply how, in this case: \\[\n    \\mathbb{E}(y_t) = \\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_t) = 0, \\forall t \\in \\{1, ..., 100\\}\n\\]\n\nNon-Stationary Time Series: A time series is non-stationary if its statistical properties change over time. Often, non-stationary series exhibit trends or varying variances. For example, a series with a trend (increasing or decreasing) is non-stationary because the mean is not constant.\n\nA common form of non-stationarity is a linear trend, where the series grows over time. In our example, the non-stationary series is generated as: \\[\n    y_t = \\epsilon_t + 0.1 \\cdot t , \\ \\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n\\] This creates a time series with a linear upward trend. In fact, similarly to what done before: \\[\n    \\mathbb{E}(y_t) = \\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_t) + \\mathbb{E}(0.1 \\cdot t) = 0.1 \\cdot t.\n\\] Therefore: \\[\n  \\forall t_1, t_2 \\in \\{1, ..., 100\\}, t_1 \\neq t_2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{E}(y_{t_1}) \\neq \\mathbb{E}(y_{t_2})\n\\]\n\nPiecewise Stationary Time Series: A piecewise stationary time series is stationary within certain segments but has changes in its statistical properties at certain points, known as changepoints. After each changepoint, the series may have a different mean, variance, or both.\n\nIn our example, the time series was stationary for the first half of the observations, but after \\(t = 50\\), a sudden shift occurs. Mathematically: \\[\ny_t = \\begin{cases}\n    \\epsilon_t & \\text{for } t \\leq 50 \\\\\n    \\epsilon_t + 5 & \\text{for } t &gt; 50\n    \\end{cases}, \\quad \\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n\\] This abrupt change at \\(t = 50\\) introduces a piecewise structure to the data.",

    "section": "1.2 Introduction to changepoints",
    "text": "1.2 Introduction to changepoints\nChangepoints are sudden, and often unexpected, shifts in the behavior of a process. They are also known as breakpoints, structural breaks, or regime switches. The detection of changepoints is crucial in understanding and responding to changes in various types of time series data.\nThe primary objectives in detecting changepoints include:\n\nHas a change occurred?: Identifying if there is a shift in the data.\nIf yes, where is the change?: Locating the precise point where the change happened.\nWhat is the difference between the pre and post-change data? This may reveal the type of change, and it could indicate differences in parameter values before and after the change.\nHow certain are we of the changepoint location?: Assessing the confidence in the detected changepoint.\nHow many changes have occurred?: Identifying multiple changepoints and analyzing each one for similar characteristics.\n\nChangepoints can be found in a wide range of time series, not limited to physical, biological, industrial, or financial processes, and which objectives to follow depends on the type of the analysis we are carrying.\nIn changepoint detection, there are two main approaches: online and offline analysis. In applications that require online analysis, the data is processed as it arrives, or in small batches. The primary goal of online changepoint detection is to identify changes as quickly as possible, making it crucial in contexts such as process control or intrusion detection, where immediate action is necessary.\nOn the other hand, offline analysis processes all the data at once, typically after it has been fully collected. The aim here is to provide an accurate detection of changepoints, rather than a rapid one. This approach is common in fields like genome analysis or audiology, where the focus is on understanding the structure of the data post-collection.\nFor instance, to give few examples:\n\nECG: Detecting changes or abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG) data can help in diagnosing heart conditions.\n\n\n\nElectrocardiograms (heart monitoring), Fotoohinasab et al, Asilomar conference 2020.\n\n\nCancer Diagnosis: Identifying breakpoints in DNA copy number data is important for diagnosing some types of cancer, such as neuroblastoma. This is a typical example of an offline analysis.\n\n\n\nDNA copy number data, breakpoints associated with aggressive cancer, Hocking et al, Bioinformatics 2014.\n\n\nEngineering Monitoring: Detecting changes in CPU monitoring data in servers can help in identifying potential issues or failures: this is often analysed in real-time on with online methods, with the aim of detecting an issue as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nTemperature data from a CPU of an AWS server. Source Romano et al., (2023)\n\n\n\nIn this module, we will focus exclusively on offline changepoint detection, where we assume that all the data is available for analysis from the start.\n\n1.2.1 Types of Changes in Time Series\nAs you might have noticed from the examples above, there’s not a strict way on which a time-series might change. Depending on the model, we could seek for different types of changes in the structure of a time series. Some of the most common types of changes include shifts in mean, variance, and trends in regression. For example, the CPU example above exihibited, in addition to some extreme observations, both changes in mean and variance.\n\nA change in mean occurs when the average level of an otherwise stationary time series shifts from one point to another. This type of change is often encountered in real-world data when there is a sudden shift in the process generating the data, such as a change in policy, market conditions, or external factors affecting the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, the red lines indicate the true mean values of the different segments.\n\nA change in variance refers to a shift in the variability of the time series data, even when the mean remains constant. This type of change is important in scenarios where the stability of a process fluctuates over time. For example, in financial markets, periods of high volatility (high variance) may be followed by periods of relative calm (low variance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.1 3. Change in Regression (Trend)\nA change in regression or trend occurs when the underlying relationship between time and the values of the time series changes. This could reflect a shift in the growth or decline rate of a process. For example, a company’s revenue might grow steadily over a period, then plateau, and later exhibit a quadratic or nonlinear growth trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 The biggest data challenge in changepoint detection\nOne of the most widely debated and difficult data challenges in changepoint detection may not be in the field of finance, genetics, or climate science—but rather in television history. Specifically, the question that has plagued critics and fans alike for years is: At which episode did “The Simpsons” start to decline?\nIt’s almost common knowledge that “The Simpsons,” the longest-running and most beloved animated sitcom, experienced a significant drop in quality over time. Critics, die-hard fans, and casual viewers alike have pointed to a shift in humor, writing, and overall creativity. But pinpointing exactly when this drop occurred is the real challenge. Fortunately, there’s a branch of statistics that was practically built to answer questions like these!\nI have downloaded a dataset (Bown 2023) containing ratings for every episode of “The Simpsons” up to season 34. We will analyze this data to determine if and when a significant shift occurred in the ratings, which might reflect the decline in quality that so many have observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, each episode of “The Simpsons” is represented by its TMBD rating, and episodes are colored by season. By visually inspecting the graph, we may already start to see some potential points where the ratings decline. However, the goal of our changepoint analysis is to move beyond visual inspection and rigorously detect the exact moment where a significant shift in the data occurs.\nJokes apart, this is a challenging time series! First of all, there’s not a clear single change, but rather an increase, followed by a decline. After which, the sequence seems rather stationary. For this reason, throughout the module, we will use this data as a running example to develop our understanding of various methods, hopefully trying to obtain a definitive answer towards the final chapters. But let’s proceed with order…",

    "section": "1.3 Detecting one change in mean",
    "text": "1.3 Detecting one change in mean\nIn this section, we will start by exploring the simplest case of a changepoint detection problem: detecting a change in the mean of a time series. We assume that the data is generated according to the following model:\n\\[\ny_t = \\mu_t + \\epsilon_t, \\quad t = 1, \\dots, n,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\) represents Gaussian noise with mean 0 and known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and \\(\\mu_t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the signal at time \\(t\\). The vector of noise terms \\(\\epsilon_{1:n}\\) is often referred to as Gaussian noise, and hence, this model is known as the signal plus noise model, where the signal is given by \\(\\mu_{1:n}\\) and the noise by \\(\\epsilon_{1:n}\\).\nIn the change-in-mean problem, our goal is to determine whether the signal remains constant throughout the entire sequence, or if there exists a point \\(\\tau\\)), where the mean shifts. In other words, we are testing whether:\n\\[\n\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_n \\quad \\text{(no changepoint)},\n\\]\nor if there exists a time \\(\\tau\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_\\tau \\neq \\mu_{\\tau+1} = \\dots = \\mu_n \\quad \\text{(changepoint at } \\tau\\text{)}.\n\\]\nNote. The point \\(\\tau\\) is our changepoint, e.g. the first point after which our mean changes, however there’s a lot of inconsistencies on the literature: sometimes you will find that people refer to \\(\\tau + 1\\) as the changepoint, and \\(\\tau\\) as the last pre-change point (as a matter of fact, please let me know if you spot this inconsistency anywhere in these notes!).\nTo address this problem, one of the most widely used methods is the CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) statistic. The basic idea behind the CUSUM statistic is to systematically compare the distribution of the data to the left and right of each possible changepoint \\(\\tau\\). By doing so, we can assess whether there is evidence of a significant change in the mean at a given point.\n\n1.3.1 The CUSUM statistics\nThe CUSUM statistic works by comparing, for each potential data point, the empirical mean (average) of the data to the left (before \\(\\tau\\)) with the empirical mean of the data to the right (after \\(\\tau\\)):\n\\[\nC_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau(n-\\tau)}{n}} \\left| \\bar{y}_{1:\\tau} - \\bar{y}_{(\\tau+1):n} \\right|,\n\\]\nOur \\(\\bar{y}_{1:\\tau}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_{(\\tau+1):n}\\) are just the empirical means of each segment, simply computed with:\n\\[\n\\bar{y}_{l:u} = \\frac{1}{u - l + 1} \\sum_{t = l}^{u} y_t.\n\\]\nThe term on the left of the difference, is there to re-scale it so that our statistics is the absolute value of normal RV that has variance 1. If there is no change, this difference is going to be distributed as a standard normal, and this is going to be a key step in drawing the distribution of the CUSUM statistic next week.\nThis approach is intuitive because if the mean \\(\\mu\\) is the same across the entire sequence, the values of the averages on both sides of any point \\(\\tau\\) should be similar. However, if there is a change in the mean, the means will differ significantly, highlighting the changepoint.\nMore formally, we would detect at change at \\(\\tau\\) if:\n\\[\n\\frac{C_{\\tau}^2 }{\\sigma^2} &gt; c,\n\\] where the \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\) is a suitable chosen threshold value (similar to a critical value in hypothesis testing!).\n\n\n1.3.2 Algorithmic Formulation of the CUSUM Statistic\nIn practice, however, we do not know the changepoint location in advance. Our goal is to detect whether a changepoint exists and, if so, estimate its location. To achieve this, we need to consider all possible changepoint locations and choose the one that maximizes our test statistic.\nThe natural extension of the likelihood-ratio test to this situation is to use as a test statistic the maximum of \\(C_\\tau\\) as we vary \\(\\tau\\):\n\\[\nC_{max} = \\max_{\\tau \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n-1\\}} C_\\tau^2 / \\sigma^2\n\\]\nAnd detect a changepoint if \\(C_{max} &gt; c\\) for some suitably chosen threshold \\(c\\). The choice of \\(c\\) will determine the significance level of the test (we’ll discuss this in more detail later). Graphically, the test will look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we detect a changepoint (i.e., if \\(C_{max} &gt; c\\)), we can estimate its location by:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} = \\arg\\max_{\\tau \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n-1\\}}  C_\\tau^2 / \\sigma^2\n\\]\nIn other words, \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\) is the value of \\(\\tau\\) that maximizes the CUSUM statistic.\nA simple estimate of the size of the change is then given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y}_{(\\hat{\\tau}+1):n} - \\bar{y}_{1:\\hat{\\tau}}\n\\]\nThis estimate represents the difference between the mean of the data after the estimated changepoint and the mean of the data before the estimated changepoint.\nIn pseudocode:\n\nINPUT: Time series \\(y = (y_1, ..., y_n)\\), threshold \\(c\\), variance \\(\\sigma\\).\nOUTPUT: Changepoint estimate \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\), maximum CUSUM statistic \\(C_{max}\\)\n\n\\(n \\leftarrow\\) length of \\(y\\)\n\\(C_{max} \\leftarrow 0\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\tau} \\leftarrow 0\\)\n\\(S_n \\leftarrow \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) // Compute total sum of y\n\\(S \\leftarrow 0\\)\n\nFOR \\(t = 1, \\dots, n - 1\\)\n  \\(S \\leftarrow S + y_t\\)\n  \\(\\bar{y}_{1:t} \\leftarrow S / t\\)\n  \\(\\bar{y}_{(t+1):n} \\leftarrow (S_n - S) / (n - t)\\)\n  \\(C_t \\leftarrow \\sqrt{\\frac{t(n-t)}{n}} |\\bar{y}_{1:t} - \\bar{y}_{(t+1):n}|\\)\n  IF \\(C_t &gt; C_{max}\\)\n    \\(C_{max} \\leftarrow C_t\\)\n    \\(\\hat{\\tau} \\leftarrow t\\)\n\nIF \\(C_{max}^2 / \\sigma &gt; c\\)\n  RETURN \\(\\hat{\\tau}\\), \\(C_{max}\\) // Changepoint detected\nELSE\n  RETURN NULL, \\(C_{max}\\) // No changepoint detected\n\nIt’s worth noting that, as we only need to calculate the CUSUM statistic for each potential changepoint once. By pre-computing the cumulative sum of all observations, this allows. The time complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the time series.\n\n\n1.3.3 Example\nRunning the CUSUM test on our Simpsons episode results in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in episode Thirty Minutes over Tokyo being the last “good” Simpsons episode, with Beyond Blunderdome being the start of the decline, according to the Gaussian change-in-mean model!",

    "text": "2.1.1 The Chi-Squared Distribution\nThe chi-squared distribution is a continuous probability distribution of the sum of squares of k independent standard normal random variables. It’s commonly used in hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. The shape of the distribution depends on its degrees of freedom (k). For k=1, it’s highly skewed, but as k increases, it becomes more symmetric and approaches a normal distribution.\nThe CUSUM statistic for a fixed τ, \\(C_τ^2/σ^2\\), follows a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom under the null hypothesis for several reasons:\n\nUnder the null hypothesis (no changepoint), the data comes from a single normal distribution with a constant mean.\nThe CUSUM statistic essentially compares two sample means: one before τ and one after τ.\nThe difference between these two sample means, when properly normalized, follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis.\nWhen we square a standard normal random variable, the result follows a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.\n\nThe “1” in “1 degree of freedom” comes from the fact that we’re essentially estimating one parameter: the difference between two means. Once this difference is known, there are no other free parameters in our comparison.\nTo visualize this, imagine a see-saw with the fulcrum at τ. The left side represents the data before τ, and the right side represents the data after τ. Under the null hypothesis, this see-saw should be balanced. The CUSUM statistic measures how much the see-saw tilts, and squaring it gives us a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.",

    "text": "2.3 2.4 Asymptotic Distribution\nTo address these challenges, we turn to asymptotic theory. In time series analysis, an asymptotic distribution refers to the distribution that our test statistic approaches as the length of the time series (n) becomes very large. It’s a theoretical concept that helps us understand the behavior of our statistic for large samples.\nFor the CUSUM test, we can use the fact that \\((C_1, ..., C_{n-1})/σ\\) are the absolute values of a Gaussian process with mean 0 and known covariance. The maximum of a set of Gaussian random variables is known to converge to a Gumbel distribution (see Theorem 2.1 of Yao and Davis (1986) and Gombay and Horvath, 1990). This convergence is described by the following equation:\n\\(\\lim_{n→∞} Pr\\{a_n^{-1}(\\max_τ C_τ/σ - b_n) ≤ u\\} = \\exp\\{-2π^{-1/2}\\exp(-u)\\}\\),\nwhere \\(a_n = (2 \\log \\log n)^{-1/2}\\) and \\(b_n = a_n^{-1} + 0.5a_n \\log \\log \\log n\\).\n\n2.3.1 2.4.1 Understanding \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\)\nThe quantities \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\) in the asymptotic distribution formula are scaling and centering constants. They help adjust the maximum CUSUM statistic so that it converges to a stable distribution as n grows large.\n\n\\(a_n\\) is a scaling factor that decreases as n increases. It ensures that the maximum CUSUM statistic doesn’t grow too quickly with n.\n\\(b_n\\) is a centering constant that shifts the distribution. It grows slowly with n, compensating for the tendency of the maximum to increase as we consider more potential changepoints.\n\nTo understand why these specific forms are used, imagine you’re measuring the highest point in different countries. As you survey more countries (increasing n), you’re more likely to find higher peaks. The \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\) terms adjust for this effect, allowing us to compare “record heights” fairly across different numbers of countries.\nIn our CUSUM context, these terms allow us to compare the significance of maximum CUSUM statistics across time series of different lengths. They ensure that our threshold for detecting a changepoint scales appropriately with the length of the series.",

    "text": "2.2 Towards More General Models: the Likelihood Ratio Test\nThe CUSUM can be viewed as a special case of a more general framework based on the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). This allow us to test for more general settings, beyond simply detecting changes in the mean.\nIn general, the Likelihood Ratio Test is a method for comparing two nested models: one under the null hypothesis, which assumes no changepoint, and one under the alternative hypothesis, which assumes a changepoint exists at some unknown position \\(\\tau\\).\nSuppose we have a set of observations \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\). Under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), we assume that all the data is generated by the same model without a changepoint. Under the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\), there is a single changepoint at \\(\\tau\\), such that the model for the data changes after \\(\\tau\\). The LRT statistic is given by:\n\\[\nLR_\\tau = - 2 \\log \\left\\{ \\frac{\\max_{\\theta} \\prod_{t=1}^n L(y_{t}| \\theta)}{\\max_{\\theta_1, \\theta_2} [(\\prod_{t=1}^n L(y_{t}| \\theta_1))(\\prod_{t=1}^n L(y_{t}| \\theta_2)]} \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe LRT compares the likelihood of the data under two models to determine which one is more likely: the enumerator, is the likelihood under the null hypothesis of no changepoint, while the denominator represents the likelihood of the data under the alternative hypothesis, where we optimise for two different parameters before and after the changepoint at \\(\\tau\\).\n\n2.2.1 Example: Gaussian change-in-mean\nThe CUSUM statistics, in fact, is nothing but a specific case of this model. To see this, we start from our piecewise costant signal, plus noise, \\(x_i = f_i + \\epsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n\\). Under this model our data, a linear combination of a Gaussian, is distributed as:\n\\[\ny_{i} \\sim N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n\n\\] Therefore, to obtain the likelihood ratio test statistic, we plug our Gaussian kernel into the LR above, and take the logarithm:\n\\[\nLR_\\tau = -2 \\left[ \\max_{\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mu)^2 \\right) - \\max_{\\mu_1, \\mu_2} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^\\tau (y_i - \\mu_1)^2 + \\sum_{i=\\tau+1}^n (y_i - \\mu_2)^2 \\right) \\right)  \\right]\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ \\min_{\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mu_1)^2 - \\min_{\\mu_1, \\mu_2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^\\tau (y_i - \\mu_1)^2 + \\sum_{i=\\tau+1}^n (y_i - \\mu_2)^2 \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nTo solve the minimization over \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\), we plug-in values \\(\\hat\\mu = \\bar{y}_{1:n}\\) on the first term, and \\(\\hat\\mu_1 = \\bar{y}_{1:\\tau}\\), \\(\\hat\\mu_2 = \\bar{y}_{(\\tau+1):n}\\) for the second term:\n\\[\nLR_\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y}_{1:n})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^\\tau (y_i - \\bar{y}_{1:\\tau})^2 - \\sum_{i=\\tau+1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y}_{(\\tau+1):n})^2 \\right]\n\\]\nThis is the likelihood ratio test statistic for a change in mean in a Gaussian model, which is essentially the CUSUM statistics squared, rescaled by the known variance:\n\\[\nLR_\\tau = \\frac{C_\\tau^2}{\\sigma^2}\n\\]\nThis is possible to prove directly after some tedious algebraic manipulations (which we will see in the workshop!).",

For simplicy, we will call our variance \\(\\sigma^2 = \\theta\\), our parameter of interest, and without loss of generality, we can center our data on zero (e.g. if \\(x_t \\sim N(\\mu, \\theta)\\), then \\(x_t - \\mu = y_t \\sim N(0, \\theta)\\)).
